<h2>MULTIDISCIPLINARY GRAPHIC DESIGNER, BASED IN UPSTATE, ROCHESTER, NY</h2>

<p>
Recently resigned from my teaching profession to return to my first love and passion; graphic design.  As a professional with an excellent record of success, I am seeking a challenging opportunity to design where my skills, education, training and many years of experience can be fully utilized. I offer experience working with both digital and offset printing.  
</p>

<p>
The best quality about myself is that I am a thinker. I am a fast learner and not afraid to take on new challenges. I take pride in the fact that I’m steadfast in my work and life. Friends, family and coworkers often comment on my perseverance and outstanding work ethics.
